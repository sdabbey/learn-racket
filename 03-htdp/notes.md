# How to Design Programs
A good program comes with a short write-up that explains what it does, what inputs it expects, and what it produces. 
Ideally, it also comes with some assurance that it actually works. 
In the best circumstances, the program's connection to the problem statement is evident so that a small change to the problem statement is easy to translate into a small change to the program. This is called **"programming product"**

## Designing Functions
We begin with a connection between *information* and *data* - This is more like choosing a representation and interpretation of data, which we call **data definitions**
