# Arithmetic
When DrRacket evaluates a string, it just echoes it back in the interactions area, like a number.
- DrRacket knows about an arithmetic of strings.
- Just like **+**, **string-append** is an operation; it makes a string by adding the second to the end of the first.
Example:
<pre>
```> (string-append "hello" "world")
    "helloworld
</pre>
